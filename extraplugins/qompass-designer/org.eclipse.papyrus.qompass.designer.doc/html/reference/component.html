<h1>Components</h1>

An Qompass component is a UML class (you might also use a UML component), since classes
contain essential properties we require of a component:
<ul>
<li>they own a set of ports and may interact through these ports. On the port level, a component needs to declare explicitly,
	which services it offers and which it requires from other others. It is important that a component does not know which
	other component will provide a required service, it only states the required services (interfaces or data-types). Thus, compared
	to an element of a classical library, dependencies on other elements are limited and the components are loosely coupled with
	their environment
<li>A class may have an explicit internal structure: a set of <i>parts</i> that are typed with other components (UML classes).
	The ports of the parts may be connected (assembly), a port of the component itself might delegate to a port of a part.
	These components are also called assembly components.
</ul>

A component might either be a type or an implementation. The former is mainly an abstract class with a set of ports
and no internal structure. It may inherit from other component types, but not from implementations.
The latter has to realize at least a subset of the services that are provided at its ports (if it does not define all, it
needs to be declared as abstract). The realization could be either done by an implementation written in a specific programming
language or the UML action language or by a delegation to an inner part.
