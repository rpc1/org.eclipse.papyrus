<h1>Port kinds</h1>

A port kind characterizes a port. Simple examples of port kinds are (1) the UseInterface and
ProvideInterface kinds which describe client/server ports and (2) PushPublisher which describe a data
publisher port for a given data type. In the first case, the port is typed with the interface that is
provided or required, in the second case, the port is typed with datatype.<br></br>
Although it does not formally define its semantics, each port kind should be associated with a
description of the intention behind it. A port kind is always associated with a <b>mapping rule</b>
that describes which interface a port provides and/or requires when in function
of its type (and/or additional information, e.g. coming from a MARTE stereotype).

On the model level, a port kind is first a stereotyped class. In Qompass, the associated mapping rule
is defined defined by means of Java code. but this is mainly an implementation issue.
Examples can be found in the plug-in org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.stdmappingRules.
