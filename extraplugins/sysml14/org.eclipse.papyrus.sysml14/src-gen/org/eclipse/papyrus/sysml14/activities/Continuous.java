 * Continuous rate is a special case of rate of flow (see Rate) where the increment of time between items approaches zero. It is intended to represent continuous flows that may correspond to water flowing through a pipe, a time continuous signal, or continuous energy flow. It is independent from UML streaming. A streaming parameter may or may not apply to continuous flow, and a continuous flow may or may not apply to streaming parameters.
