This plugin is created to regroup actions which can be used in : 
   - oep.uml.modelexplorer
   - oep.sysml.modelexplorer
   
for example, the handler RenameNamedElementHandler works with UML, 
but if we choose distribute a Papyrus for SysML version, 
we can exclude oep.uml.modelexplorer, nevertheless, we need to Rename UML Element.

So this plugin was created to avoid this kind of problem.
