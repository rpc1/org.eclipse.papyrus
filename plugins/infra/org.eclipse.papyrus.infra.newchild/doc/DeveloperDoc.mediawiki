= New Child Menu into the model explorer =
==Requirements==
- AddNewChild (id=newChild001): 
 Papyrus shall add in the menu new child for new customized elements by using extended type
- HideElement (id=newChild002): 
 Papyrus shall not display all UML or SysML element creation
- newChildFromProfile (id=newChild003): 
 Papyrus shall add the creation of new element from a subset of profile
- newChildMenuDisplay (id=newChild004): 
 Papyrus shall be able to associated icons to folder or creation menu
- RoleAndElementCreation (id=newChild005): 
 When an element can created from several  roles for a container, Papyrus shall let the possibility to choose the role or to let to the possibility to be created from all role.
==Use Cases==

===UseCreateMenu===
The Papyrus User shall use this functionality from the model explorer in order to create elements in the model. It can decide to display or not this element creation
====How to====
A user can create an element by  select element in the model explorer, click on it ant then click on the diagram.
In order to not display a menu,  a user can edit the model that represent the creation menu and set the attribute visibility to false.

===Create or modify ElementCreationModel===
An advanced User is able to create of modify creation menu. This menu is a model that can be edited 
====How to====
An advanced user can contribuate to the menu by adding a new plugin that contains:
*a xmi file that represents a creation menu. The model must be a instance of org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/resource/elementCreationMenuModel.ecore. It contains<br>
**CreationMenu<br>
***It correspond to a menu<br>
***The ElemenTypeIDRef correspond a reference to the element Type.<br>
***The role can be filled in order to specify the role play by the element.<br>
***If displayAllRole is set to true, it displays all roles played by the element if the number of roles is greater than 1. By default this property is true;<br>
**Folder<br>
***It is possible to add owns label an icon.<br>
**Visibilty to specify if the folder is visible.<br>
*a reference to an extension point, to specify that papyrus must take in account this file display the menu<br>

<code>
<extension
         point="org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild">
      <menuCreationModel
            model="YourCreationMenu.xmi">
      </menuCreationModel>
</extension>
</code>

In the following example, a menu creation for a package is presented. This menu is contained in the folder SimpleUMLTest. We have associated a image for this menu.

<br>[[Image:C:\git\org.eclipse.papyrus\plugins\infra\org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild\doc\imgDOC\PackageWithIconOIllustration.png|Result for this menu]]<br>

In this following example, a creation menu will be specify  to allow creation of nested classifier. That 's why the role "nestedClassifier" is precised. The label for this creation is "nestedClass"
<br>[[Image:C:\git\org.eclipse.papyrus\plugins\infra\org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild\doc\imgDOC\NestedClassifierIllustration.png|Result for the menu nestedClass]]<br>
<br>[[Image:C:\git\org.eclipse.papyrus\plugins\infra\org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild\doc\imgDOC\NestedClassifier.png|Creation menu model for nested class]]<br>

In the following example a creation menu is created for activities. In this case, all roles are displayed. Thanks to this, when we want to associate an activity to a state, 3 roles are proposed.

===Generate "ElementCreationModel" from a profile===
From a stereotyped profile, a model of new child menu can be generated.
For example a user after designing a profile, want to have a dedicated menu  from this profile/
For the moment this function is not implemented.
===Hide, change order or add submenus===
The User can modify the creation menu by adding submenus: order about new child menu, precise if the role must be displayed.
====How to====
It only needed to change the order of element in the corresponding creation menu model

===Create or modify ElementCreationModel at runtime thanks to a GUI===
A user  can edit a the model that represent the creation menu  at runtime for papyrus thanks to a dedicated UI.
For the moment this function is not implemented.
