= Stereotype Display via Property View =
== Introduction ==
By default the stereotype display is managed by the CSS (see [./stereotype-display-css.html Stereotype Display via CSS]. )

But if the user wants to customize the stereotype display for a specific element, it can be done through the property view, under the ''Appearance'' tab, after the Shape customization.

== Table Presentation ==
The stereotype display can be managed via a table that contains 5 columns:
Two columns for the Label:
* Depth : The depth of the stereotype name.
* Visible: Define if the Label should be displayed or hidden.
Tree columns for the properties:
* In Braces: Define if the property should be displayed in braces.
* In Compartment:  Define if the property should be displayed in a compartment (only for nodes).
* In Comment: Define if the property should be displayed in a comment.

== Stereotype Label ==
The label of a stereotype contains the name of this stereotype on top of the node. 
This name can contain the whole path or only the last segment. If several stereotypes have the same last segment, it can be usefull to display more segments in order to make the difference between them.
This can be customized through the depth attribute. 

=== Depth ===
The depth column, allows the user to specify a depth for the selected view:

[[File:images/stereotype-display/StereotypeDisplayTable_depth.JPG |400px]]

The depth can be "full", "none" or a negative number that trims as many segments as indicated to the full path. 

==== Example: ====
If the full path is : 
 <nowiki>SysML::Blocks::Block</nowiki>
Then the depth "-1" corresponds to:
 <nowiki>Blocks::Block</nowiki>
Then the depth "-2" corresponds to:
 <nowiki>Block</nowiki>
Same as the depth "none".

=== Visible ===
The "Visible" column allows the user to hide specific stereotype Label. If the stereotype information is useless for the user, just disable the check box. 

== Stereotype Properties ==
In addition of its name, stereotypes have properties most of time. 
Those properties can be displayed at different locations:
* In Comment
* In Compartment (for nodes only)
* In Braces

=== Display Locations ===

==== In Braces ====
To display a stereotype property in braces, check the checkbox in the "In Braces" column, in front of the related property for a single property, or in front of the Stereotype to display all the properties in braces. 

==== In Comment ====
To display a stereotype property in comment, check the checkbox in the "In Comment" column, in front of the related property for a single property, or in front of the Stereotype to display all the properties in comment. 

==== In Compartment ====
If the selected element is a Node (a Class , an Interface, a DataType ,... ), the properties can be displayed into a compartment into this node. To display a stereotype property in compartment, check the checkbox in the "In Compartment" column, in front of the related property for a single property, or in front of the Stereotype to display all the properties in compartment.

== Remarks == 
*If a display is not possible (for example: trying to display properties into a compartment for a connection), no alert will inform you. Just nothing will happen. 

*If the display doen't refresh when checking the different display checkboxes, it can help to refresh the diagram (F5).
