= Stereotype Display by CSS =
Since Papyrus 1.1, the applied stereotypes display of an element can be managed via CSS. 
In order to understand what those CSS represents, here is some pieces of information. 

First of all the applied stereotypes can display their Name and / or their Properties.

== Stereotype Name Display ==
The Name of the Stereotype can be displayed with different depth.
Full depth means that all the path of the stereotype is displayed.

 <nowiki> Full depth  => "SysML::Blocks::Block"</nowiki>

No depth means that just the last segment is displayed. 

 <nowiki> No depth  => "Block"</nowiki>

== Stereotype Properties Display ==
The Properties of a stereotype can be displayed in 3 different locations:
* In a '''compartment''' in case of node element (ex: a Class, a Block)
* In '''braces''' into the header of the element
* In an external figure as a '''comment'''

== Default display settings ==
By default, only the name of the Stereotypes with no depth are displayed.
None of the properties are displayed.

For your information, here is the default CSS implemented for the stereotype display.

=== Default CSS ===
The following CSS rules are implemented by default for all the Diagrams:

<source lang="css">
Shape[type=StereotypeComment]{
	visible:false;
}

StereotypeComment Compartment[type=StereotypeBrace]{
	visible:false;
}

Compartment[type=StereotypeCompartment]{
	visible:false;
}

Compartment[type=StereotypeBrace]{
	visible:false;
}

Label[type=StereotypeLabel]{
	depth:"none";
}

</source>

== Override the default settings ==

To override the default settings, a new CSS has to be implemented.


=== CSS Exemple ===
Here is some exemple of CSS to display the Stereotype:

<source lang="css">

/* To modify the depth */
Label[type=StereotypeLabel]{
	depth:"-1";
}

/* To make the properties visible into compartment */
Compartment[type=StereotypeCompartment]{
	visible:true;
}

/* Hide the property "allocatedTo" into the compartment */
Compartment[type=StereotypeCompartment]>[property="allocatedTo"]{
	visible:false;
}

/* Hide all the properties into the Compartment of the stereotype Block */
Compartment[stereotype="SysML::Blocks::Block"]{
	visible:false;
}

/* Display the Comment shape */
StereotypeComment{
	visible:true;
}

/* Display the properties in Brace into the Comment*/
StereotypeComment Compartment[type=StereotypeBrace]{
	visible:true;
}

</source>
